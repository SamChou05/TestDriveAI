This project is for DubHacks 2024. It is an AI-powered platform that aims to take the subjectivity out of driving tests. Users can upload dash cam footage and driver footage, which our fine-tuned machine learning models analyze to provide insights and assessments on driving performance. Our goal is to better prepare drivers for the roads, ultimately reducing the damage caused by underqualified drivers.
