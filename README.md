Goal: To take the subjectivity out of driving tests and provide an automated standardized driving test experience to reduce accidents due to underqualified drivers, and to also provide driving schools an all-in-one tool as an alternative to human proctoring.

It is an AI-powered platform that aims to take the subjectivity out of driving tests. We created a web based application in order to have a user friendly experience. Users can upload dash cam footage and driver footage, which our fine-tuned machine learning models analyze to provide insights and assessments on driving performance. We utilized the Intel Tiber Cloud Development Platform as well as their AI tools to fine tune our machine learning models, allowing us to effectively implement a number of computer vision techniques such as object detection and classification.

What's next for Test Drive AI:

We plan to refine the detection algorithms to cover more safety violations, such as speeding and hard braking. Additionally, we aim to expand our platform to be used by driving schools, offering a comprehensive solution for road safety assessment and driver education.

Tools we used:
  - Fine Tuned YOLO5 machine learning model
  - PyTorch
  - CV2
